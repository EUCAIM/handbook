# 3\. Onboarding Process {#3.-onboarding-process}

EUCAIM defines a federated infrastructure in which nodes provide with data and services[^3].

## 3.1. Initial requirements and commitments {#3.1.-initial-requirements-and-commitments}

EUCAIM defines two ways of participating as data holders, each with unique capabilities and contributions in both research and clinical environments[^4]:

* **Data holders transferring data to a Reference Repository**. If you have completed research projects and aim to maintain your datasets for long-term research availability but need support, EUCAIM offers a solution. By contributing to one of our Reference Nodes, you will ensure that data remains accessible to other researchers. The process involves signing a Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) and sharing information about your project, metadata catalogue, and software. We will guide you through data de-identification, making your contribution hassle-free.

* **Federated Data Holders**: If you manage active repositories and want to maintain your datasets within a federated node, EUCAIM provides the platform. As a Federated Data Holder, you'll collaborate with us through a Data Sharing Agreement (DSA). Share details about your research project, metadata catalogue, and software, along with information about your local computational and storage capabilities.

## 3.2. Legal documents. {#3.2.-legal-documents.}

A set of legal agreements must be prepared and signed to clearly state the obligations and responsibilities of the parties involved. The process is simpler in the case of Data Transfer Data Holders, as documents related to security and Service Level Agreements are provided by the reference nodes where the data will be deposited. Federated nodes have to provide a guarantee that they can fulfill the security and performance requirements[^5]. [Figure 3](#fig_legaldiagram) graphically shows the information and steps required for the legal framework of EUCAIM. 

![Figure 3: Information and steps required to complete the legal framework of EUCAIM.](figures/image3.png) Figure 3: Information and steps required to complete the legal framework of EUCAIM.

It is essential that the data holder provides a contact person of its legal team to be in close communication with the legal team of EUCAIM. A contact point will be assigned during the onboarding process.

The first step will be to Complete the ethical training via the Moodle platform ([https://training.eucaim.cancerimage.eu/](https://training.eucaim.cancerimage.eu/))[^6]. Then, the ethical and legal requirements for data holders are different depending on the collaboration model chosen:

* **Data holders who agree to transfer data to a reference node**:

1. Proof of legal representation and legal basis in the case of data transfer involving multiple data holders (such as consortium or formal cooperation agreements).

2. The signature of the DTA with its annexes.

3. A copy of a favorable ethical approval (if applicable).

4. A report from the Data Protection Officer (DPO) confirming legal compliance (i.e., justification for data sharing).

5. Any documents required under your national legislation (e.g., authorization from a data protection authority, health authority, or any other relevant body)[^7]. 

6. State other restrictions that should be requested to data users. For example, there could be:  
   1. Prohibitions on commercial use of the data.  
   2. Restrictions due to intellectual property rights.  
   3. Restrictions on use depending on the conditions of the expression of consent by the data subject.

* **Data holders who want to set up their own federated node**:

1. Proof of legal representation and legal basis in the case of data sharing involving multiple data holders (e.g., consortium agreements, formal cooperation agreements, etc.).

2. The signature of the DSA with its annexes.

3. A copy of a favorable ethical approval (if applicable).

4. A report from the Data Protection Officer (DPO) confirming legal compliance (i.e., justification for data sharing).

5. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and documents demonstrating the security of the information system. To demonstrate security tasks, some reference to international or national security standards like ISO 27001 will save time. Or results or a periodic external audit.

6. Any documents required under your national legislation (e.g., authorization from a data protection authority, health authority, or any other relevant body). 

7. Other restrictions. For example, there could be:

   1. Prohibitions on commercial use of the data.  
   2. Restrictions due to intellectual property rights.  
   3. Restrictions on use depending on the conditions of the expression of consent by the data subject.

In both cases it is compulsory that the DPO and/or the legal representative of the Data Holder confirm that they are aware about the transfer or sharing the data within EUCAIM and the security measures that must be taken.
